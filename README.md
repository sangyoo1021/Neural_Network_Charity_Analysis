# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

Using knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, binary classifier is used to predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. 


## Results
The prediction IS_SUCCESSFUL which is the money used effectively will be the target for the model. 
All other variables except EIN and NAME are considered the features of the model. 
EIN and NAME can be removed from the input data. 
The hidden layer 1 was 90 and hidden layer2 was 20 with 44 input features.  
The target was 80% accuracy but was only able to achieve 72.55%
To optimize, an additional layer was added but it was still under the target. 



## Summary
For this data, I would use other types of models so that we can achieve the targeted accuracy.
